# Feather CSS
A Small CSS Library (~500 SLOC) meant for creating simple and minimalistic UIs. It is written in Pure CSS and does not require any compilations or complicated installations.

Feather CSS is inspired from Skeleton CSS and also borrows some of its code. Without their work this project would not have been possible. [Website](http://getskeleton.com/)
